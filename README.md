TODO
====

[ ] Smarter choice of neighbours in all 8 quadrants (by client?)
[ ] Only update visible portions of the map (use a refset?)
[ ] Highlight the user; click to change colour
[ ] Show user's neighbours, or local neighbour links?
[ ] Maybe each indiv has more than 1 dot?
[ ] Show "neighbours" view, ie trad gol view:
    - this requires each client to identify its nbrs by direction
    - would be nice to do dynamic transition between map and nbrs...
    - it doesn't matter if we have "surprising" topology, e.g. some
    people shown twice
